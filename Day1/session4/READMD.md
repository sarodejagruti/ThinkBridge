Static Portfolio Site: Version 1
Overview
This project is the initial version of my personal static portfolio website. It serves as a foundational exercise to reinforce core web development principles and Git workflow. The site is constructed using semantic HTML5 for structure and modern CSS for styling, providing a clean and responsive user interface.

Key Objectives
Version Control Mastery: Demonstrate proficiency with fundamental Git commands (init, branch, commit, push, pull, merge).

Semantic Markup: Build a well-structured and accessible website using appropriate HTML5 sectioning elements (<header>, <main>, <footer>, <section>).

Component-Based Layout: Create distinct and modular sections for About, Projects, and Contact information.

Navigation & User Experience: Implement a responsive navigation bar with smooth scrolling functionality to enhance user experience.

Collaborative Workflow Simulation: Practice and document the process of a self-review and merge using a Pull Request (PR) on a public Git repository.
