Web Development Keywords App
This is a simple, browser-only web application that provides a quick reference for fundamental keywords in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app is a tabbed interface, allowing users to easily switch between sections to view a brief description of each language.

Features
Interactive Tabs: A clean navigation bar with buttons to switch between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript content.

Dynamic Content: The application displays different content sections based on the selected tab, hiding and showing the relevant information without reloading the page.

Responsive Design: The simple layout is designed to be functional and easy to read on various screen sizes.

Clean Code: The project is organized into three separate files for a clear separation of concerns:

index.html: Defines the structure and content of the web page.

style.css: Manages the styling and visual presentation.

script.js: Handles the interactive behavior of the tabs.

Getting Started
To run this application, simply open the index.html file in any modern web browser. There is no need for a web server or any complex setup.

How it Works
The application uses a basic JavaScript function to control the visibility of the content sections. When a user clicks a button in the navigation bar, the showSection() function is called. This function performs the following actions:

Hides all content sections by adding the hidden CSS class.

Removes the active class from all navigation buttons.

Shows the selected content section by removing the hidden class.

Highlights the clicked button by adding the active CSS class, providing visual feedback to the user.
